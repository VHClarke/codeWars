For simplicity, you will not be tested on the ability to handle corner cases (e.g. "%*&#()%&^#" or similar strings containing alphabetical characters at all) - an ALL CAPS (uppercase) string will simply be defined as one containing no lowercase letters. Therefore, according to this definition, strings with no alphabetical characters (like the one above) should return True.

String.prototype.isUpperCase = function() {
  return this.toUpperCase() === this.toString();
}
